# MyBeezBox technical test for developer candidates

First off, thank you for your interest in MyBeezBox. We appreciate your application, and the time you will dedicate during this process.  
The goal of this test is for us to understand if we'd be happy working together. It's an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and your ability to communicate with your fellow developers :)

## The actual test

Your mission is to build a voucher purchase website. The client has outlined the following requirements:
- The client should be available to configure different vouchers, with personalized image, description and price for each of them
- A buyer should be able to buy one of these vouchers
- The client should be able to follow their sales, and mark a voucher as used

### Technical details

Please do not spend more than three hours of your time working on this test. We value your time, and we also want to see what you are able to do in a timely manner.  
This test is extremely broad, on purpose. **We do not expect you to deliver a production ready application in three hours**. Focus on the skills you want to showcase. Feel free to take shortcuts and make simplifying assumptions whenever needed.

We should have sent you an email address to send your work to. The format of the result is up to you: a fork of this repo, a zipped git repository, a docker image, etc.  
Please make it clear how we should install your code if needed, and how we should **run** it.

If you have questions about the test, don't hesitate to reach out to us ðŸ“§

## What you can expect after your submission

We will take a look at your submission as soon as we're able. Again, we value your time.  
If we decide not to move forward, we will let you know via email. We will try and include feedback regarding the code you sent.  
If we decide to move forward, you will be invited to a 1h interview. We will go over your submission, ask questions, talk about your choices, think about what you could do if you had more time, etc.

Looking forward to hearing from you :v:
